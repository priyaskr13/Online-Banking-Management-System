# Online-Banking-Management-System
Project Under Development

Online Banking is one of the most important financial activities which will be carried out by any person who holds a bank account. The Online Banking Management System is a web-based application that allows customers to perform various banking transactions such as transferring money, paying bills, checking account balance, and managing their account information from anywhere at any time. The system is developed using Java as the programming language and Spring Boot as the web framework. Thymeleaf is used as the template engine, Spring MVC is used as the controller layer, and MS SQL Server is used as the backend database. JPA and Hibernate are used as the ORM tools to perform database operations. 
The system has two main user roles, the customer, and the administrator. Customers can log in to their account to view their account information, transaction history, and perform various transactions. They can also update their profile information and change their password. The administrator can manage customer accounts, view transaction reports, and perform various administrative tasks. The system has a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and secure.
